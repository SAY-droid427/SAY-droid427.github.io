                                deployed on cost effective and resource constrained devices like
                                the Raspberry Pi Pico and ESP32. Our setup has given results
                                comparable to more advanced and expensive devices for the

                                In our research, we have successfully developed a comprehensive and self-contained system that captures ECG signals using 
                                ECG electrodes, AD8232 for collection of ECG signals. The system includes signal processing, sleep apnea detection using Deep Learning models, and displaying the
                                results on an OLED screen. Our study compares the performance of different micro-controllers with varying capacities and 
                                costs: Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32, and Arduino Nano BLE Sense. We have achieved comparable accuracies to those of 
                                expensive industrial devices at a significantly lower cost. This work lays the foundation for the development of wearable 
                                devices capable of detecting sleep apnea without the need for internet connectivity or data transmission. This work can be extended for any other 
                                body signals like EEG.

                            <h4>21st March, 2024</h4>
                            <h3> Epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain electrical activity, affects 50 million people worldwide, necessitating efficient seizure detection methods. Traditional manual EEG signal analysis is time-consuming and error-prone, prompting the adoption of machine learning and deep learning for automation.
                                 Our novel approach combines 1-D Convolutional layers with Bidirectional LSTM and GRU, alongside Average pooling, for feature extraction. Tested on the Bonn dataset with five-fold cross-validation, our model achieves high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
                                 Our model demonstrates 99–100% accuracy for binary seizure classification, 97.2%–99.2% for normal-interictal-seizure classification, and 95.81%–98% for five-class classification.
                                 Our model significantly improves performance metrics for binary and multiclass classifications, showcasing its effectiveness in accurately detecting epileptic seizures across varying EEG signal lengths. This suggests its potential as a reliable tool for automated seizure detection, enhancing epilepsy diagnosis and management.</h3>
